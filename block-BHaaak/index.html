       <p>March and April are wonderful months to experience springtime in the Himalayas. This is when winter starts to recede; snow is still around. A carpet of fresh grass sprouts around these snow patches. The landscape is a riot of colours. Itâ€™s the best experience of both, snow and greenery </p>

        These are best treks in March and April. These are fast-filling too, so plan your trek soon.

       <h3> Kuari Pass</h3>
       <img src="kuari.jpeg" alt="Kuari pass view">
       <p>Irrespective of you being a seasoned trekker or a beginner the Kuari Pass is a trek you need to do. It is a must-do for the views of some of Indiaâ€™s most celebrated mountains â€“ Mt Nanda Devi (25,673 feet) and Mt. Dronagiri (23,182 feet) â€“ in any season. In winter there is an added attraction. The snow in its almost perfectly crafted forests. Snow flakes settled on the Oak leaves above a white carpeted forest floor takes you instantly to the land which would be Santa Clauses envy.</p>
        <h4> Difficulty level of the trek </h4>
        <p>Kuari Pass is an easy-moderate trek, which makes it easy enough for someone starting out in the Himalayas. </p>
        <h4> Best time to trek in Kuari Pass</h4>
        <p> March and April are the best times to trek in this beautiful trek</p>
